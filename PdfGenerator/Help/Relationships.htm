<P>Now we are going to make some relationships between data streams and their 
columns. This step is not required and you can skip it if you don't need any 
relationship. This kind of relationship is same as relationship thing in SQL 
Servers.</P>
<P>This is done by selecting data stream and column on the left and on the right 
and press button "Set Relationship -&gt;"</P>
<P>Off course if you made a mistake, you can simply delete relationship by 
selecting it and pressing button "Delete".<BR>This is left to right relationship 
meaning one-to-many relationship from left to right. <BR><BR>Example: </P>
<P>If you have Persons data stream&nbsp;on the left side and Telephone data 
stream on the right side, you would connect ID on the left with PersonID on the 
right, making situation where one person can have multiple telephones.</P>
<P>After you done press button "Next &gt;&gt;"</P>
