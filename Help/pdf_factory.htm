<p><strong>AxiomCoders PDF Factory</strong> is our core native library that is used to generate PDF files from given template and data. This library does not contain any code that can be used to gather data from any data source, and user of this library is responsible of manually feeding it with data. This would mean that this library will not read any database, any file or do anything similar to get data for reports.<br>
All data gathering is done through appropriate callbacks. </p>
<p>This library can be used on both Windows and Linux operating systems. <br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions related to PDF Factory, as this is somehow specific tool please <a href="mailto:support@axiomcoders.com">contact us.</a><br>
