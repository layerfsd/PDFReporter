<P><IMG height=672 alt="main application" src="screenshots/Main window-Created project.jpg" width=877></P>
<P>If you ever worked with any reporting tool you will first notice big 
difference on how reports are made in this editor. This editor is completely 
made to look like regular drawing tool. Be sure to read step-by-step pages of 
this help and How To pages in order to fully understand how it works. Although 
there are not items like sections/subsections and concept of creating reports is 
different our main goal was to made editor to be simple and easy to use.</P>
<P>As this editor don't contain sections/subsections items and gives you ability 
to draw anywhere on report page it is well suited for use by designers or any 
other person that is not familiar with reporting concepts of sections.</P>
<P>One thing user could ask himself is why we even removed concept of sections 
(headers, footers, etc) when such concept is working fine in other tools; and 
here is our answer. Main reason for changing concept of drawing reports is to 
enable user to customize his reports with more freedom. With this new concept 
you can create more powerful reports where attention is put to designing reports 
and not understanding how data is organized and put onto reports. If you are not 
sure what this actually means please visit our <A href="#">samples page online</A> that contains many sample reports that 
will show you what do we mean by "powerful" reports.</P>
<P><STRONG>Why is this tool free? </STRONG><BR><BR>This tool is completely free 
because we wanted to give chance to anyone to be able to draw report templates. 
This way if you are developer using compete our package you could for example 
give predefine sets of report templates with your application and later if any 
user of your application wants to change how reports look like he can do it by 
using this editor without any problems. Because of this free editor you also 
give chance for your users to change their reports anytime for free without even 
contacting you, which can save you money and time.</P>
<P><STRONG>I am not sure I understand this, Why do I need this editor? 
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>AxiomCoders PDF Reports</STRONG> is complete solution for generating 
pdf files from template files (reports) and your data. As other components like 
<STRONG>PDF Reports .NET Component</STRONG> require template files in order to 
generate PDF files from your data you need to have some kind of tool to design 
this templates. This is place where this Template Editor comes in. Of course 
template report files are saved in standard xml format and if you want you can 
even modify these files manually (which we do not recommend). </P>
