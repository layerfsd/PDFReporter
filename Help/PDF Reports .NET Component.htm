<P><STRONG>AxiomCoders PDF Reports .NET Component</STRONG> is .NET assembly that 
is used for generating PDF reports from any kind of data.</P>
<P>By using this component you will give your applications ability to generate 
PDF reports. </P>
<P>Some examples on implementation of this component would be:</P>
<P>- Your application can make price-lists in PDF formats where you keep your 
products and data in SQL Server. <BR>- Your application can make nicely designed 
catalogs of your products with images and descriptions where you keep your data 
in database.<BR>- Your application need to generate reports for data that is 
gathered through some network or maybe some hardware (in this case you would use 
manual data feeding mechanism by callbacks)<BR><STRONG><BR>Main Advantages of 
PDF Reports .NET Component: </STRONG><BR><BR>- You don't need to have all data 
ready in your memory to generate your report. If you for example have 1,000,000 
rows in table that you want to generate you can do this by manually feeding 
<STRONG>PDF Reports</STRONG> with blocks of data. <BR>- Your data does not need 
to be available at all once, and you can feed <STRONG>PDF Reports </STRONG>with 
data as data arrives<BR>- If relationship between your data is really 
complicated and require some manual intervention <STRONG>PDF Reprots</STRONG> 
can handle this<BR>- Data used for generating reports can come from any possible 
data source. (e.g. you could use information from hardware ports in order to 
give data to your <STRONG>PDF Reports</STRONG> generator) <BR>- You can generate 
your PDF file continuosly for as long as you want. This is useful in cases when 
you receive your data with some delay. (e.g. You get your data minute by minute 
from your network). <BR>- You have more freedom on how your reports will look 
like. Please check our online samples page to see what kind of reports can be 
created <A href="http://www.axiomcoders.com/products/92-pdf-reports-samples">here</A>. </P>
